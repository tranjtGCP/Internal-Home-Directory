## Topic: 
Our project will be to create a home inventory management system where a user can scan items in and out of a modular inventory system. The user can input items manually, as well as through receipts or other documents so that they have a constantly up-to-date manifest of their current items. The hope of this project is to reduce waste and gamify using items that the user already has.
