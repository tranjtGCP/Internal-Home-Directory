## Topic: 
Our project will focus on a home inventory management system in which a user could scan receipts of orders / shopping trips or documents, whether they be from a brick-and-mortar store, an online order, or other various miscellaneous documents that
indicate a change in inventory, and have a constantly up-to-date list of their inventory,
