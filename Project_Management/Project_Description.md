## Topic: 
Our project is a simple home inventory system designed for everyday home use. Items can be added and removed through the web interface, and can be easily searched and filtered through. A server hosting a SQLite database is used for persistent storage. Our goal is to push users to reduce waste through gamification that encourages thoughtful consumption.
