# Justification
The majority of the time I spent on the frontend involved learning how to use ReactJS along with a component library: Material UI. Other than that, I was mainly thinking and researching over how to design the layout of the application. I had thought that my experience in Angular and Angular Material would help, however ReactJS is a differently functioning frontend framework, which proved to be difficult.
