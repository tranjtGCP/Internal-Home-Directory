# Justification
The majority of the time I spent on the frontend involved learning how to use ReactJS along with a component library: Material UI. Other than that, I was mainly thinking and researching over how to design the layout of the application. I had thought that my experience in Angular and Angular Material would help, however ReactJS is a differently functioning frontend framework, which proved to be difficult. In terms of the actual React development, getting the pages to connect with each other with React routing, being able to iterate through dictionaries and lists provided by the backend/database, and filterng were important frontend features that I mainly focused on.
