# Justification
I primarily worked on the backend and database of this project. Most of my time was spent designing the functions that interact directly with the database, get_data being the largest and most versitile of these functions. get_data took 5 hyper-parameters and parsed the database to return a complete set of items in page format for the frontend to render. Automated testing was done using pytest for databaseIO.py, and was used to generate the sample dataset that was used for frontend testing and performace debugging. API integration was critical in making sure the frontend and backend communicated data properly and that any errors in fetching data were handled properly. In total I spent about 50 hours working on this project through research, coding, integration, and testing.
