Topic: 
To Be Confirmed - Our project will focus on either a home inventory management system in which a user would scan receipts of orders / shopping trips or
documents, whether they be from a brick-and-mortar store, an online order, or other various miscellaneous documents that indicate a change in inventory
or a live-captioning device that will let a user review real-time conversation history.
