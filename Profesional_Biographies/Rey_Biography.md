**Professional Experience:**

**Trans Voice Project, University of Cincinnati** (August 2024 - present)
- Currently working on the TruVox project at the University of Cincinnati. This software is designed to assist speech pathologists in helping transgender individuals who desire to change their voice. This project requires signal processing to be done on the users voice to track key metrics over time such as pitch, resonance, and vocal quality.
- Working alongside speech pathologists and researchers to build software that is useful and effective.

  

**Software Engineer, 3dB Labs** (May 2021 - May - 2024)
- Acted as the lead engineer in developing an integrated SDR solution for two models of laptop systems. Responsible for 3d modeling, PCB design, and hardware integration. Critical in fulfilling the largest order of this product ever received, producing significant revenue for 3dB.
- Developed a plugin for audio processing in C++ using open source libraries. Easily allows for visualization of audio signals in a spectrum analyzer, spectrogram, and oscilloscope. Customers were excited to see this plugin implemented, and has been used by engineers for internal testing.

**Capstone Project Interests:**

**Signal Processing:**
- Applications of vocal processing on speech would be an interesting area to research into. There are many commonly used algorithms that analyze speech that would be applicable to other applications.
- Recreate basic signal processing algorithms and tools such as FFT, spectrogram, oscilloscope, and modulators.

**Data Classification:**
- Create a model using a database that allows for easy data identification and classification. This could take the form of labeling images, documents, or webpages.
- Build a machine learning model to label and classify data for easy searchability. This would be a useful took for any large database.
